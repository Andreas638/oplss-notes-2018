There are many possible ways and choices of designing a programming language around algebraic operations and handlers, but we shall mostly rely on Matija Pretnar's tutorial [An Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers](http://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf). Invited tutorial paper. A more advanced treatment is available in [An effect system for algebraic effects and handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6316).
