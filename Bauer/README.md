### Algebraic Effects and Handlers

+ [Effects bibliography](https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography)
+ [Effects Rosetta Stone](https://github.com/effect-handlers/effects-rosetta-stone)
+ [Programming language Eff](http://www.eff-lang.org/)
+ [Formalized proofs about Eff](https://github.com/matijapretnar/proofs/)

There are many possible ways and choices of designing a programming language around algebraic operations and handlers, but we shall mostly rely on Matija Pretnar's tutorial [An Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers](http://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf). Invited tutorial paper. A more advanced treatment is available in [An effect system for algebraic effects and handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6316).

### Github Repository

Andrej also created a [github repo](https://github.com/OPLSS/introduction-to-algebraic-effects-and-handlers) that contains many more resources related to his lectures.

The repository is at https://github.com/OPLSS/introduction-to-algebraic-effects-and-handlers
