call by name just means you can pass _trees_ through application or transition steps, instead of "only passing" "values"

"val" is understood by dividing states into terminating and nonterminating. it is fine to say "every state is terminating", if you must.

-- ifthenelse is an elim rule for Bool!
-- - in linear systems, this corresponds to "consume resource". 

there is no unit elim nor is there void intro.

CS: "types are a proxy for behavior"
logic: "______ are a proxy for propositions" (missed this) 

"type erasure" from system f is like compiling to untyped LC. untyped LC is the //assembly language// of system f. 



---------------


in linear logic: 

resources on left are things you are given 
resources on right are obligatoins. 


linear lambda calculus just means that type safety IS resource safety.
