greedy scheduling can be messy, low level, unwieldy concurrency; BUT truthful if you compile it from a higher-level language (w parallel- rather than concurrent- semantics. 

tabulate is "interpret a set as a bijection from int, which is array"

iterate is like foldl in haskell

reduce is a contraction. each recursive call takes one step w a binary operation. its like fold w/o right or left preference, trying to assoc things which are next to eachother.

remark-- linear type systems don't parallel!
